[![Build status](https://ci.appveyor.com/api/projects/status/gu22l7ihuwlq94su/branch/master?svg=true)](https://ci.appveyor.com/project/ripclawffb/chocolatey-microsoft-powershellforgithub-psmodule/branch/master)

This is a PowerShell module that provides stateless command-line interaction and automation for the GitHub v3 API.

Embracing the benefits of PowerShell, it has full support for pipelining, allowing you pipe the output of virtually any command into any other command within the module.
